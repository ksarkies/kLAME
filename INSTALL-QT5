kLAME GUI wrapper for LAME
--------------------------

I use Ubuntu Linux so all instructions will be biassed to that distribution.
If other distros are used, note that mp3lame may not be available due to
intellectual property issues. Refer to the INSTALL-QT4 instructions for
suggestions.

LAME MP3 saw its last release in 2011 at v3.99 and is unlikely to be further
developed.

Install the following packages from the Ubunut repositories:

qt4-developer
qt5-qmake
g++
libmp3lame0
libmp3lame-dev

For compilation from tarball, unpack the source file

$ tar -xjf klame-3.0.0.tar.bz2

change to the klame-3.0.0 directory and run:

$ qmake
$ make

The binary klame will appear in the same directory and can be copied to a
suitable location eg /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin.

For testing, a project file trinity.qlp is provided. I have not put any test
wav files in as they are too big. The project file may need to be changed to
suit the paths of your installation. The results go to the archive and mp3
directories. There are also some predefined settings in the lame-options
directory.
